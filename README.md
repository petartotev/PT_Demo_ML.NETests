Information:
The repository contains a Solution with a series of Projects that experiment with the ML.NET Library. 

- **Binary Classification** (Sentiment Analysis)
- **Multiclass Classification** - guesses the category/genre of a book/movie/joke - based on a pre-trained model with a file in a format (category,summary/n...)
- **Object Detection** - finds all the familiar objects in an image (person, dog, horse, bike, car etc.)

Credits:
Using those was a piece of cake thanks to:
- the Microsoft Tutorials about ML.NET
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dluB5VE1m1k&feature=emb_logo - a lecture of Nikolay Kostov (@NikolayIT) presented in Software University in 2020.
