# PT_Demos_ML.NETests
The repository contains a solution with a series of projects that experiment with the ML.NET Library. Object Detection and Sentiment Analysis are the ones successfully implemented. Using those was a piece of cake thanks to the Microsoft Tutorials about ML.NET and a lecture of Nikolay Kostov (@NikolayIT) presented in Software University in 2020.
